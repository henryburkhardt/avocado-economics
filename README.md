# avocado-economics
Ever wondered aboout the economics of the avocado industry in the united stated? I have, and this repository is the fruits of my labor analyzing avocado prices in the United States by geographic region over the past several years. The data is publicly avalaible from the Hass Avocado Board website. My analysis was done using R, and Python (in a Jupyter notebook setup).

The final product is the HTML file included above, which can be downloaded (it is rather large), to acess the interactive data visualtions I created. Currently, I am adding a [recurrent nerual network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) to predict future prices in major US cities.
